## A Frontendmentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) that required me to integrate with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

I used the React framework, styled components & sass for styling.

Features include: 
See all countries from the API on the homepage, 
Search for a country using an input field, 
Filter countries by region, 
Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page, 
Click through to the border countries on the detail page, 
Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode
